### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating


### Built with

- HTML5 
- CSS3 custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- A lot of guidance from my mentor


### Continued development

I think I'd like to focus on improving my understanding of Javascript. It seems a bit tricky but all I seem to be missing in the practical experience. Onwards! lol.
